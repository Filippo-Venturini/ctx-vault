PROJECT ATLAS - INTERNAL ONLY
Confidential Company Document

Project Overview:

Atlas is our next-generation semantic search platform integrating quantum-inspired optimization algorithms with transformer-based retrieval. Target launch: Q3 2025.

Technical Architecture:

The system combines dense retrieval (bi-encoder embeddings) with quantum annealing for result re-ranking. Initial benchmarks show 40% improvement in retrieval precision over traditional vector search on our internal knowledge base.

Core components:
- Custom embedding model fine-tuned on 10M company documents
- Hybrid search combining semantic and keyword matching
- Quantum optimizer for multi-objective ranking (relevance + recency + authority)

Business Impact:

Expected to reduce internal knowledge discovery time by 60%, translating to estimated $2.3M annual productivity savings across engineering and research teams.

Competitive advantage: Our quantum-hybrid approach is 18 months ahead of competitors based on patent landscape analysis.

Team & Resources:

Lead: Dr. Sarah Chen (Quantum Computing)
Team size: 12 engineers (6 ML, 4 quantum, 2 infra)
Budget: $4.5M allocated for 2025

Current milestones:
- Alpha testing with 50 internal users (completed Jan 2025)
- Beta rollout to 500 users (scheduled Mar 2025)
- Production deployment (target Jul 2025)

Key Challenges:

Quantum hardware access remains bottlenecked. Currently using IBM Quantum cloud with 127-qubit processors, but experiencing queue times during peak hours.

Embedding model bias detected in legal document retrieval - 15% lower precision for contracts vs technical docs. Mitigation plan in progress.

Integration with existing SSO and access control systems requires security audit (scheduled Feb 2025).

Strategic Partnerships:

In discussions with IBM Research for dedicated quantum compute access. Potential co-marketing opportunity post-launch.

Exploring licensing model for enterprise customers - recurring revenue potential $15-20M ARR by 2027.

Risk Assessment:

Technical risk: Medium. Core algorithms validated, but quantum hardware stability uncertain.
Market risk: Low. Strong internal demand signals from product teams.
Competitive risk: Medium-High. Must launch before competitors catch up.

Next Steps:

Finalize beta user feedback analysis by end of February.
Complete security audit and compliance review.
Prepare launch materials and internal training programs.
