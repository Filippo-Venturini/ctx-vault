# CtxVault

CtxVault is a **local semantic search engine** for LLM applications.

Index documents, generate embeddings, and query with semantic search — all on your machine.

**Built for:**
- **Personal RAG** - your private knowledge base with semantic search
- **Multi-agent systems** - shared memory layer across agents
- **Isolated contexts** - separate vaults for different knowledge domains

Works as CLI tool or API server. Zero cloud dependencies.

---

## Why CtxVault

**Local-first**
Runs entirely offline with no external dependencies. Your knowledge base stays on your machine, and you control where the retrieved context goes.

**Multi-vault architecture**
Run isolated vaults for different contexts - personal notes, company docs, or agent-specific knowledge.

**Agent-ready**
Built-in API server for seamless integration with LangChain, LangGraph, and custom agent workflows.

**Developer-first**
Simple CLI for manual work, HTTP API for automation. Works offline, no setup complexity.

# Installation

Python **3.10+**

### From PyPI (recommended)

```bash
pip install ctxvault
```

### From source (dev mode)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Filippo-Venturini/ctxvault
cd ctxvault
pip install -e .
```

---

# Quickstart (CLI)

Initialize a vault:

```bash
ctxvault init ./my-vault
```

Add documents:

```bash
ctxvault index ./my-vault/docs
```

Query:

```bash
ctxvault query "what is project Orion?"
```

List indexed documents:

```bash
ctxvault list
```

---

# CLI Commands

### init

Initialize a vault directory.

```bash
ctxvault init <path>
```

---

### index

Index a file or directory recursively.

```bash
ctxvault index <path>
```

---

### query

Semantic search.

```bash
ctxvault query "<text>"
```

Returns the most relevant chunks.

---

### delete

Remove a document from the vault.

```bash
ctxvault delete <path>
```

---

### reindex

Re-index a modified file.

```bash
ctxvault reindex <path>
```

---

### list

Show all indexed documents with metadata.

```bash
ctxvault list
```

---

# API Server (FastAPI)

CtxVault can also run as an HTTP service for agents or external tools.

## Start the server

From your environment:

```bash
uvicorn ctxvault.api.main:app --reload
```

Server will start at:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

---

## Interactive docs (recommended)

FastAPI automatically provides Swagger UI:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
```

Use this to explore and test endpoints interactively.

This is preferred over manually documenting every request.

---

## Available endpoints

Base path: `/ctxvault`

| Method | Endpoint   | Description       |
| ------ | ---------- | ----------------- |
| POST   | `/init`    | initialize vault  |
| PUT    | `/index`   | index file/folder |
| POST   | `/query`   | semantic search   |
| GET    | `/list`    | list indexed docs |
| DELETE | `/delete`  | delete file       |
| PUT    | `/reindex` | reindex file      |
| POST   | `/write`   | write & index file|      |

---

## Example (curl)

### Query

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/ctxvault/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"what is project Orion?"}'
```

# CLI vs API – when to use what?

### Use CLI when

* working locally
* indexing manually
* debugging
* scripting
* personal usage

### Use API when

* integrating with agents
* LangGraph / LangChain workflows
* backend services
* automation pipelines
* multi-process access

Both share the same core engine.

---

# Examples

Real integrations are available in:

```
examples/
```

Planned:

* agent integration
* LangGraph workflow
* notebook demo
* API usage scripts

---

# Privacy

All processing happens locally.

* no cloud
* no telemetry
* no external calls
* your documents never leave your machine

---

# Roadmap

* [x] CLI MVP
* [x] FastAPI server
* [ ] sync / file watcher
* [ ] multi-vault support
